                  draft-ietf-masque-h3-datagram-latest

Abstract

   The QUIC DATAGRAM extension provides application protocols running
   over QUIC with a mechanism to send unreliable data while leveraging
   the security and congestion-control properties of QUIC.  However,
   QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to demultiplex
   application contexts.  This document describes how to use QUIC
   DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC is
   HTTP/3.  It associates datagrams with client-initiated bidirectional
   streams and defines an optional additional demultiplexing layer.
   Additionally, this document defines how to convey datagrams over
   prior versions of HTTP.

1.  Introduction

   The QUIC DATAGRAM extension [DGRAM] provides application protocols
   running over QUIC [QUIC] with a mechanism to send unreliable data
   while leveraging the security and congestion-control properties of
   QUIC.  However, QUIC DATAGRAM frames do not provide a means to
   demultiplex application contexts.  This document describes how to use
   QUIC DATAGRAM frames when the application protocol running over QUIC
   is HTTP/3 [H3].  It associates datagrams with client-initiated
   bidirectional streams and defines an optional additional
   demultiplexing layer.  Additionally, this document defines how to
   convey datagrams over prior versions of HTTP.

   This document is structured as follows:

   *  Section 2 presents core concepts for multiplexing across HTTP
      versions.

      -  Section 2.1 defines datagram contexts, an optional end-to-end
         multiplexing concept scoped to each HTTP request.

      -  Contexts are identified using a variable-length integer.
         Requirements for allocating identifier values are detailed in
         Section 2.2.

   *  Section 3 defines how QUIC DATAGRAM frames are used with HTTP/3.
      Section 5 defines an HTTP/3 setting that endpoints can use to
      advertise support of the frame.

   *  Section 4 introduces the Capsule Protocol and the "data stream"
      concept.  Data streams are initiated using special-purpose HTTP
      requests, after which Capsules, an end-to-end message, can be
      sent.

      -  Datagram Capsule types Section 4.4 are defined, along with
         guidance for defining new capsule types.

1.1.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Multiplexing

   When running over HTTP/3, multiple exchanges of datagrams need the
   ability to coexist on a given QUIC connection.  To allow this, HTTP
   datagrams contain two layers of multiplexing.  First, the QUIC
   DATAGRAM frame payload starts with an encoded stream identifier that
   associates the datagram with a given QUIC stream.  Second, datagrams
   optionally carry a context identifier (see Section 2.1) that allows
   multiplexing multiple datagram contexts related to a given HTTP
   request.  Conceptually, the first layer of multiplexing is per-hop,
   while the second is end-to-end.

   When running over HTTP/2, the first level of demultiplexing is
   provided by the HTTP/2 framing layer.  When running over HTTP/1,
   requests are strictly serialized in the connection, therefore the
   first layer of demultiplexing is not needed.

2.1.  Datagram Contexts

   Within the scope of a given HTTP request, contexts provide an
   additional demultiplexing layer.  Contexts determine the encoding of
   datagrams, and can be used to implicitly convey metadata.  For
   example, contexts can be used for compression to elide some parts of
   the datagram: the context identifier then maps to a compression
   context that the receiver can use to reconstruct the elided data.

   Any HTTP Methods or protocols enabled by HTTP Upgrade Tokens that use
   HTTP Datagrams MUST define the format of datagrams for the default
   context, which has a context ID of 0.

   Non-default contexts (contexts with a non-zero ID) are OPTIONAL to
   implement for both endpoints.  Intermediaries do not require any
   context-specific software to enable such contexts.  Methods or
   protocols that use HTTP Datagrams can independently define whether or
   not non-default contexts are supported, and how to negotiate support
   for contexts if needed.  Such methods or protocols can define new
   HTTP Capsule types (Section 4.1) to register a context ID and
   indicate the meaning or format of datagrams that have that context
   ID.  For guidance on registering contexts with capsules, see
   Section 4.5.

   While stream IDs are a per-hop concept, context IDs are an end-to-end
   concept.  In other words, if a datagram travels through one or more
   intermediaries on its way from client to server, the stream ID will
   most likely change from hop to hop, but the context ID will remain
   the same.  Context IDs are opaque to intermediaries.

   When contexts are used, they are identified within the scope of a
   given request by a numeric value, referred to as the context ID.  A
   context ID is a 62-bit integer (0 to 2^62-1).

2.2.  Context ID Allocation

   Implementations of HTTP Datagrams that support datagram contexts MUST
   provide a context ID allocation service.  That service will allow
   applications co-located with HTTP to request a unique context ID that
   they can subsequently use for their own purposes.  The HTTP
   implementation will then parse the context ID of incoming HTTP
   Datagrams and use it to deliver the frame to the appropriate
   application context.

   Even-numbered context IDs are client-initiated, while odd-numbered
   context IDs are server-initiated.  This means that an HTTP client
   implementation of the context ID allocation service MUST only provide
   even-numbered IDs, while a server implementation MUST only provide
   odd-numbered IDs.  Note that, once allocated, any context ID can be
   used by both client and server - only allocation carries separate
   namespaces to avoid requiring synchronization.  Additionally, note
   that the context ID namespace is tied to a given HTTP request: it is
   possible for the same numeral context ID to be used simultaneously in
   distinct requests.

3.  HTTP/3 DATAGRAM Format

   When used with HTTP/3, the Datagram Data field of QUIC DATAGRAM
   frames uses the following format (using the notation from the
   "Notational Conventions" section of [QUIC]):

   HTTP/3 Datagram {
     Encoded Stream ID (i),
     [Context ID (i)],
     HTTP Datagram Payload (..),
   }

                      Figure 1: HTTP/3 DATAGRAM Format

   Encoded Stream ID:  A variable-length integer that contains an
      encoded value indicating the client-initiated bidirectional stream
      that this datagram is associated with.  The Encoded Stream ID for
      a datagram without a context ID is the associated stream ID
      divided by two.  The Encoded Stream ID for a datagram with a
      context ID is the associated stream ID divided by two, plus one.
      (Client-initiated bidirectional streams have stream IDs that are
      divisible by four, so the stream ID divided by two always has the
      least-significant bit set to zero).  The largest legal QUIC stream
      ID value is 2^62-1, so the largest legal value of Encoded Stream
      ID is (2^62-1 / 2) + 1.  Receipt of a frame that includes a larger
      value MUST be treated as a connection error of type
      FRAME_ENCODING_ERROR.  A datagram without a context ID is
      implicitly using a context ID of 0.

   Context ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the context ID of
      the datagram (see Section 2.1).  Whether or not this field is
      present depends on whether the least-significant bit of the
      Encoded Stream ID is set, as described above.  If the receiver of
      a datagram does not support Context IDs, it will drop any datagram
      that contains a context ID.  If the Context ID field is not
      present, this datagram is associated with the default context
      (which has its Context ID set to 0).

   HTTP Datagram Payload:  The payload of the datagram, whose semantics
      are defined by individual applications.  Note that this field can
      be empty.

   Intermediaries parse the Encoded Stream ID field in order to
   associate the QUIC DATAGRAM frame with a stream.  This is done by
   first checking if the least-significant bit of the Encoded Stream ID
   is set (which indicates if the datagram includes a context ID),
   clearing that bit, and multiplying the result by two to generate the
   client-initiated bidirectional stream ID.  If an intermediary
   receives a QUIC DATAGRAM frame whose payload is too short to allow
   parsing the Encoded Stream ID field, the intermediary MUST treat it
   as an HTTP/3 connection error of type H3_GENERAL_PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Endpoints parse both the Encoded Stream ID field and the Context ID
   field in order to associate the QUIC DATAGRAM frame with a stream and
   context within that stream.  If an endpoint receives a QUIC DATAGRAM
   frame whose payload is too short to allow parsing the Encoded Stream
   ID field, the endpoint MUST treat it as an HTTP/3 connection error of
   type H3_GENERAL_PROTOCOL_ERROR.  If an endpoint receives a QUIC
   DATAGRAM frame whose payload is long enough to allow parsing the
   Encoded Stream ID field but too short to allow parsing the Context ID
   field, the endpoint MUST abruptly terminate the corresponding stream
   with a stream error of type H3_GENERAL_PROTOCOL_ERROR.

   Endpoints MUST NOT send HTTP/3 datagrams unless the corresponding
   stream's send side is open.  On a given endpoint, once the receive
   side of a stream is closed, incoming datagrams for this stream are no
   longer expected so the endpoint can release related state.  Endpoints
   MAY keep state for a short time to account for reordering.  Once the
   state is released, the endpoint MUST silently drop received
   associated datagrams.

   If an HTTP/3 datagram is received and its Encoded Stream ID maps to a
   stream that has not yet been created, the receiver SHALL either drop
   that datagram silently or buffer it temporarily while awaiting the
   creation of the corresponding stream.

4.  Capsules

   This specification introduces the Capsule Protocol.  The Capsule
   Protocol is a sequence of type-length-value tuples that allows
   endpoints to reliably communicate request-related information end-to-
   end, even in the presence of HTTP intermediaries.

4.1.  Capsule Protocol

   This specification defines the "data stream" of an HTTP request as
   the bidirectional stream of bytes that follow the headers in both
   directions.  In HTTP/1.x, the data stream consists of all bytes on
   the connection that follow the blank line that concludes either the
   request header section, or the 2xx (Successful) response header
   section.  In HTTP/2 and HTTP/3, the data stream of a given HTTP
   request consists of all bytes sent in DATA frames with the
   corresponding stream ID.  The concept of a data stream is
   particularly relevant for methods such as CONNECT where there is no
   HTTP message content after the headers.

   Definitions of new HTTP Methods or of new HTTP Upgrade Tokens can
   state that their data stream uses the Capsule Protocol.  If they do
   so, that means that the contents of their data stream uses the
   following format (using the notation from the "Notational
   Conventions" section of [QUIC]):

   Capsule Protocol {
     Capsule (..) ...,
   }

                  Figure 2: Capsule Protocol Stream Format

   Capsule {
     Capsule Type (i),
     Capsule Length (i),
     Capsule Value (..),
   }

                          Figure 3: Capsule Format

   Capsule Type:  A variable-length integer indicating the Type of the
      capsule.  Endpoints that receive a capsule with an unknown Capsule
      Type MUST silently skip over that capsule.

   Capsule Length:  The length of the Capsule Value field following this
      field, encoded as a variable-length integer.  Note that this field
      can have a value of zero.

   Capsule Value:  The payload of this capsule.  Its semantics are
      determined by the value of the Capsule Type field.

4.2.  Requirements

   If the definition of an HTTP Method or HTTP Upgrade Token states that
   it uses the capsule protocol, its implementations MUST follow the
   following requirements:

   *  A server MUST NOT send any Transfer-Encoding or Content-Length
      header fields in a 2xx (Successful) response.  If a client
      receives a Content-Length or Transfer-Encoding header fields in a
      successful response, it MUST treat that response as malformed.

   *  A request message does not have content.

   *  A successful response message does not have content.

   *  Responses are not cacheable.

4.3.  Intermediary Processing

   Intermediaries MUST operate in one of the two following modes:

   Pass-through mode:  In this mode, the intermediary forwards the data
      stream between two associated streams without any modification of
      the data stream.

   Participant mode:  In this mode, the intermediary terminates the data
      stream and parses all Capsule Type and Capsule Length fields it
      receives.

   Each Capsule Type determines whether it is opaque or transparent to
   intermediaries in participant mode: opaque capsules are forwarded
   unmodified while transparent ones can be parsed, added, or removed by
   intermediaries.  Intermediaries MAY modify the contents of the
   Capsule Data field of transparent capsule types.

   Unless otherwise specified, all Capsule Types are defined as opaque
   to intermediaries.  Intermediaries MUST forward all received opaque
   CAPSULE frames in their unmodified entirety.  Intermediaries MUST NOT
   send any opaque CAPSULE frames other than the ones it is forwarding.
   All Capsule Types defined in this document are opaque, with the
   exception of the datagram capsules, see Section 4.4.  Definitions of
   new Capsule Types MAY specify that the newly introduced type is
   transparent.  Intermediaries MUST treat unknown Capsule Types as
   opaque.

   Intermediaries respect the order of opaque CAPSULE frames: if an
   intermediary receives two opaque CAPSULE frames in a given order, it
   MUST forward them in the same order.

   Endpoints which receive a Capsule with an unknown Capsule Type MUST
   silently drop that Capsule.

4.4.  The Datagram Capsules

   This document defines the DATAGRAM and DATAGRAM_WITH_CONTEXT capsules
   types, known collectively as the datagram capsules (see Section 8.3
   for the value of the capsule types).  These capsules allow an
   endpoint to send a datagram frame over an HTTP stream.  This is
   particularly useful when using a version of HTTP that does not
   support QUIC DATAGRAM frames.

   Datagram Capsule {
     Type (i) = DATAGRAM or DATAGRAM_WITH_CONTEXT,
     Length (i),
     [Context ID (i)],
     HTTP Datagram Payload (..),
   }

                     Figure 4: DATAGRAM Capsule Format

   Context ID:  A variable-length integer indicating the context ID of
      the datagram (see Section 2.1).  This field is present in
      DATAGRAM_WITH_CONTEXT capsules but not in DATAGRAM capsules.  If a
      DATAGRAM capsule is used on a stream where datagram contexts are
      in use, it is associated with context ID 0.  DATAGRAM_WITH_CONTEXT
      capsules MUST NOT carry context ID 0 as that context ID is
      conveyed using the DATAGRAM capsule.

   HTTP Datagram Payload:  The payload of the datagram, whose semantics
      are defined by individual applications.  Note that this field can
      be empty.

   Datagrams sent using the datagram capsule have the exact same
   semantics as datagrams sent in QUIC DATAGRAM frames.  In particular,
   the restrictions on when it is allowed to send an HTTP Datagram and
   how to process them from Section 3 also apply to HTTP Datagrams sent
   and received using the datagram capsules.

   The datagram capsules are transparent to intermediaries, meaning that
   intermediaries MAY parse them and send datagram capsules that they
   did not receive.  This allows an intermediary to reencode HTTP
   Datagrams as it forwards them: in other words, an intermediary MAY
   send a datagram capsule to forward an HTTP Datagram which was
   received in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame, and vice versa.

   Note that while datagram capsules are sent on a stream,
   intermediaries can reencode HTTP Datagrams into QUIC DATAGRAM frames
   over the next hop, and those could be dropped.  Because of this,
   applications have to always consider HTTP Datagrams to be unreliable,
   even if they were initially sent in a capsule.

   If an intermediary receives an HTTP Datagram in a QUIC DATAGRAM frame
   and is forwarding it on a connection that supports QUIC DATAGRAM
   frames, the intermediary SHOULD NOT convert that HTTP Datagram to a
   DATAGRAM capsule.  If the HTTP Datagram is too large to fit in a
   DATAGRAM frame (for example because the path MTU of that QUIC
   connection is too low or if the maximum UDP payload size advertised
   on that connection is too low), the intermediary SHOULD drop the HTTP
   Datagram instead of converting it to a DATAGRAM capsule.  This
   preserves the end-to-end unreliability characteristic that methods
   such as Datagram Packetization Layer Path MTU Discovery (DPLPMTUD)
   depend on [RFC8899].  An intermediary that converts QUIC DATAGRAM
   frames to datagram capsules allows HTTP Datagrams to be arbitrarily
   large without suffering any loss; this can misrepresent the true path
   properties, defeating methods such a DPLPMTUD.

4.5.  Registering Datagram Contexts with Capsules

   Methods or protocols that support multiple datagram payload formats
   or separate types of datagrams can differentiate them using datagram
   contexts (Section 2.1).

   Such protocols can define a new Capsule type that is used to register
   a context ID with the peer endpoint.

   For example, if a new method needed to define a non-default context
   for the "Example" datagram format, it could define a new capsule type
   (REGISTER_EXAMPLE_FORMAT) that indcludes a context ID value.
   Endpoints that understand this new capsule type would be able to
   consequently handle and parse datagrams on the context ID, while all
   other endpoints would ignore the datagrams.

   REGISTER_EXAMPLE_FORMAT Capsule {
     Type (i) = REGISTER_EXAMPLE_FORMAT, // For example only
     Length (i),
     Context ID (i),
   }

              Figure 5: REGISTER_EXAMPLE_FORMAT Capsule Format

5.  The H3_DATAGRAM HTTP/3 SETTINGS Parameter

   Implementations of HTTP/3 that support HTTP Datagrams can indicate
   that to their peer by sending the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter with
   a value of 1.  The value of the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter MUST
   be either 0 or 1.  A value of 0 indicates that HTTP Datagrams are not
   supported.  An endpoint that receives the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS
   parameter with a value that is neither 0 or 1 MUST terminate the
   connection with error H3_SETTINGS_ERROR.

   Endpoints MUST NOT send QUIC DATAGRAM frames until they have both
   sent and received the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter with a value of
   1.

   When clients use 0-RTT, they MAY store the value of the server's
   H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter.  Doing so allows the client to send
   QUIC DATAGRAM frames in 0-RTT packets.  When servers decide to accept
   0-RTT data, they MUST send a H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter greater
   than or equal to the value they sent to the client in the connection
   where they sent them the NewSessionTicket message.  If a client
   stores the value of the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter with their
   0-RTT state, they MUST validate that the new value of the H3_DATAGRAM
   SETTINGS parameter sent by the server in the handshake is greater
   than or equal to the stored value; if not, the client MUST terminate
   the connection with error H3_SETTINGS_ERROR.  In all cases, the
   maximum permitted value of the H3_DATAGRAM SETTINGS parameter is 1.

5.1.  Note About Draft Versions

   [[RFC editor: please remove this section before publication.]]

   Some revisions of this draft specification use a different value (the
   Identifier field of a Setting in the HTTP/3 SETTINGS frame) for the
   H3_DATAGRAM Settings Parameter.  This allows new draft revisions to
   make incompatible changes.  Multiple draft versions MAY be supported
   by either endpoint in a connection.  Such endpoints MUST send
   multiple values for H3_DATAGRAM.  Once an endpoint has sent and
   received SETTINGS, it MUST compute the intersection of the values it
   has sent and received, and then it MUST select and use the most
   recent draft version from the intersection set.  This ensures that
   both endpoints negotiate the same draft version.

6.  Prioritization

   Data streams (see Section 4.1) can be prioritized using any means
   suited to stream or request prioritization.  For example, see
   Section 11 of [PRIORITY].

   Prioritization of HTTP/3 datagrams is not defined in this document.
   Future extensions MAY define how to prioritize datagrams, and MAY
   define signaling to allow endpoints to communicate their
   prioritization preferences.

7.  Security Considerations

   Since this feature requires sending an HTTP/3 Settings parameter, it
   "sticks out".  In other words, probing clients can learn whether a
   server supports this feature.  Implementations that support this
   feature SHOULD always send this Settings parameter to avoid leaking
   the fact that there are applications using HTTP/3 datagrams enabled
   on this endpoint.

8.  IANA Considerations

8.1.  HTTP/3 SETTINGS Parameter

   This document will request IANA to register the following entry in
   the "HTTP/3 Settings" registry:

           +==============+==========+===============+=========+
           | Setting Name | Value    | Specification | Default |
           +==============+==========+===============+=========+
           | H3_DATAGRAM  | 0xffd277 | This Document | 0       |
           +--------------+----------+---------------+---------+

                        Table 1: New HTTP/3 Settings

8.2.  HTTP Header Field Name

   This document will request IANA to register the following entry in
   the "HTTP Field Name" registry:

   Field Name:  Sec-Use-Datagram-Contexts

   Template:  None

   Status:  provisional (permanent if this document is approved)

   Reference:  This document

   Comments:  None

8.3.  Capsule Types

   This document establishes a registry for HTTP capsule type codes.
   The "HTTP Capsule Types" registry governs a 62-bit space.
   Registrations in this registry MUST include the following fields:

   Type:  A name or label for the capsule type.

   Value:  The value of the Capsule Type field (see Section 4.1) is a
      62-bit integer.

   Reference:  An optional reference to a specification for the type.
      This field MAY be empty.

   Registrations follow the "First Come First Served" policy (see
   Section 4.4 of [IANA-POLICY]) where two registrations MUST NOT have
   the same Type.

   This registry initially contains the following entries:

           +=======================+==========+===============+
           | Capsule Type          | Value    | Specification |
           +=======================+==========+===============+
           | DATAGRAM              | 0xff37a1 | This Document |
           +-----------------------+----------+---------------+
           | DATAGRAM_WITH_CONTEXT | 0xff37a2 | This Document |
           +-----------------------+----------+---------------+

             Table 2: Initial Capsule Types Registry Entries

Appendix A.  Examples

A.1.  CONNECT-UDP

   In this example, the client does not support any CONNECT-UDP nor HTTP
   Datagram extensions, and therefore has no use for datagram contexts
   on this stream.  Each datagram payload is expected to contain a UDP
   payload.

   Client                                             Server

   STREAM(44): HEADERS             -------->
     :method = CONNECT
     :protocol = connect-udp
     :scheme = https
     :path = /target.example.org/443/
     :authority = proxy.example.org:443

   DATAGRAM                        -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 22
     Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload

              <--------  STREAM(44): HEADERS
                           :status = 200

   /* Wait for target server to respond to UDP packet. */

              <--------  DATAGRAM
                           Encoded Stream ID = 22
                           Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload

A.2.  CONNECT-UDP with Timestamp Extension

   In these examples, the client supports a CONNECT-UDP Timestamp
   Extension, which uses a different Datagram Format Type that carries a
   timestamp followed by the encapsulated UDP payload.  Datagrams on the
   default context (0) are expected to contain UDP payloads, while
   contexts established with the REGISTER_UDP_WITH_TIMESTAMP_CONTEXT
   capsule include a timestamp along with the UDP payload.  A new
   header, Sec-UDP-Timestamps, indicates support for the extension.

A.2.1.  Extension Supported

   In this instance, the server supports non-default datagram contexts
   for the timestamp extension.  The client registers a context for UDP
   payloads with timestamps once it learns that the extension is
   supported.

   Client                                             Server

   STREAM(44): HEADERS            -------->
     :method = CONNECT
     :protocol = connect-udp
     :scheme = https
     :path = /target.example.org/443/
     :authority = proxy.example.org:443
     Sec-UDP-Timestamps = ?1

   DATAGRAM                        -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 22
     Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload

              <--------  STREAM(44): HEADERS
                           :status = 200
                           Sec-UDP-Timestamps = ?1

   /* UDP timestamps are supported on this stream */

   STREAM(44): DATA               -------->
     Capsule Type = REGISTER_UDP_WITH_TIMESTAMP_CONTEXT
     Context ID = 2

   DATAGRAM                        -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 23
     Context ID = 2
     Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload With Timestamp

              <--------  DATAGRAM
                           Encoded Stream ID = 22
                           Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload

A.2.2.  Extension Unsupported

   In this instance, the server does not support non-default datagram
   contexts for the timestamp extension.

   Client                                             Server

   STREAM(44): HEADERS            -------->
     :method = CONNECT
     :protocol = connect-udp
     :scheme = https
     :path = /target.example.org/443/
     :authority = proxy.example.org:443
     Sec-UDP-Timestamps = ?1

   DATAGRAM                        -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 22
     Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload

              <--------  STREAM(44): HEADERS
                           :status = 200

   /* UDP timestamps are not supported on this stream */

              <--------  DATAGRAM
                           Encoded Stream ID = 22
                           Payload = Encapsulated UDP Payload

A.3.  CONNECT-IP with IP compression

   Client                                             Server

   STREAM(44): HEADERS            -------->
     :method = CONNECT
     :protocol = connect-ip
     :scheme = https
     :path = /
     :authority = proxy.example.org:443
     Sec-Use-IP-Compression = ?1

              <--------  STREAM(44): HEADERS
                           :status = 200
                           Sec-Use-IP-Compression = ?1

   /* Exchange CONNECT-IP configuration information. */

   DATAGRAM                       -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 22
     Payload = Encapsulated IP Packet

   /* Endpoint happily exchange encapsulated IP packets */
   /* using Encoded Stream ID 22 and Context ID 0.      */

   DATAGRAM                       -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 22
     Payload = Encapsulated IP Packet

   /* After performing some analysis on traffic patterns, */
   /* the client decides it wants to compress a 2-tuple.  */


   STREAM(44): DATA                -------->
     Capsule Type = REGISTER_IP_COMPRESSION_CONTEXT
     Context ID = 2
     Compression Tuple = "192.0.2.6,192.0.2.7"

   DATAGRAM                       -------->
     Encoded Stream ID = 23
     Context ID = 2
     Payload = Compressed IP Packet

A.4.  WebTransport

   Client                                             Server

   STREAM(44): HEADERS            -------->
     :method = CONNECT
     :scheme = https
     :method = webtransport
     :path = /hello
     :authority = webtransport.example.org:443
     Origin = https://www.example.org:443

              <--------  STREAM(44): HEADERS
                           :status = 200

   /* Both endpoints can now send WebTransport datagrams. */
